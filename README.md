# vim-gtest

**Vim plugin to run [*GoogleTest*](https://github.com/google/googletest) using https://github.com/benmills/vimux**

<p align="center"><img src="http://pezzato.net/2015/12/20/vim-gtest.gif" /></p>

## Usage

### Select gtest command

```
:GTestCmd path/to/test/executable
```

### Select tests by name

You can select test cases and test name, with autocompletion.

```
:GTestCase MyTestCase
:GTestName MyTestName
```

### Run selected tests

```
:GTestRun
```

### Find tests

Go to the prev/next test in the current buffer.

```
:GTestPrev
:GTestNext
```

### Run test under cursor

```
:GTestRunUnderCursor
```

### CtrlP

Don't you know what [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim) is?

It's a fantastic fuzzy finder for vim! Try it immediately!

`vim-gtest` extends *ctrlp.vim* with a google test finder. Now you can find
and launch tests at the speed of light!

### QuickFix

You can tell `vim-gtest` to highlight failing tests using vim's *QuickFix*.

```
:let g:gtest#highlight_failing_tests = 1
:GTestRun
:GTestHighlight
```

If you have [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) installed,
calling `:GTestHighlight` isn't needed.

any contribution you make. Beer is also appreciated â˜º

### Testing

To test this plugin you need to test it with a testable project. `googletest`
can test itself. Yeah, like a ship-shipping ship shipping shipping ships.

This will download and compile google test and its unit tests:

```
./test/make_test
```

Now from `vim`, just call from command line `:GTestCmd ./test/launch`.

After editing this plugin, just `:source %` and try something. Samples unit
tests can be found in `test/googletest/googletest/samples` directory.
